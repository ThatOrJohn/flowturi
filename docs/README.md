# Flowturi Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for Flowturi, a flexible and animated Sankey diagram renderer.

## Documents

- [Sankey Philosophy](./sankey-philosophy.md): A high-level overview of our values, UX goals, and guiding principles when designing and animating Sankey diagrams.
- [Sankey Layout Strategy](./sankey-layout-strategy.md): A technical deep dive into how we handle layout stability, historical vs. real-time rendering, and animation smoothness.

## About Flowturi

Flowturi supports two primary operating modes:

- **Historical Mode**: Pre-analyzed data is animated over time.
- **Real-time Mode**: Ingests and animates data as it arrives.

Our focus is on visual clarity, smooth transitions, and intelligent layout behavior across both modes.
